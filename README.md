# ACME Company

> The company ACME offers their employees the flexibility to work the hours they want. But due to some external circumstances, they need to know what employees have been at the office within the same time frame. This app returns as output a table containing pairs of employees and how often they have coincided in the office. This app uses as input .txt files where are saved the employee's worked hours.
